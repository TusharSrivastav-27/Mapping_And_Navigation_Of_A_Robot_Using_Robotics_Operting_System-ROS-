# Mapping_And_Navigation_Of_A_Robot_Using_Robotics_Operting_System-ROS-

In this project my task was to move our robot in a office automatically by it's own from multiple points. It should also hav to detect all the obstacles like table,chair etc and have to make the shortest path to it's destinations without colliding to these obstacles. So to acheive this first of all our robot makes a 2d map of the entire office using gmapping technique and then it localises itself on that map and then makes the shortest path to it's destination point by keeping in mind about all the obstacles.

Our robot have sensors like LIDAR,Depth sensing camera etc.
